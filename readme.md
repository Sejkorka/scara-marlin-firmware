# SCARA Motion Firmware Documentation

This repository currently hosts documentation for replicating the toolchain setup and initial bring-up procedure for the SCARA-based motion platform. Firmware sources will land in future revisions; for now, the focus is on capturing the reproducible process the lab follows to build, flash, and validate the controller.

## Available Guides

- [Setup and First-Movement Test Guide](docs/setup-and-test.md) – Required toolchain, PlatformIO build/upload flow, serial console usage, mechanical calibration notes, bring-up checklist, and a minimal bench-test G-code script.

Contributions that expand the procedure or add new hardware-specific notes are welcome. Please keep any future changes synchronized with the steps outlined in the linked guide so new team members can rely on a single source of truth.
